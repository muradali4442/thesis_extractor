# Abstract

The rapid expansion of biomedical research articles presents both a challenge and an opportunity for advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The challenge lies in the integration and interpretation of diverse data formats, including text, tables and supplementary materials, to uncover meaningful insights. This thesis addresses the limitations of current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models, which often fail to adequately utilize non-textual modalities such as tables and figures. By leveraging large language models (LLMs), this work aims to enhance the extraction and synthesis of information from biomedical research articles, answering competency questions (CQs) with greater accuracy and depth.

This research focuses on open-source papers from IEEE and two CEUR Workshop Proceedings: the Artificial Intelligence for Healthcare 2024 (CEUR-WS Vol-3880) and the 2nd AIxIA Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Healthcare (HC@AIxIA 2023) (CEUR-WS Vol-3578). Using a RAG approach, textual and tabular data were extracted, preprocessed and indexed with tools such as PyPDF2, Tabula and the BM25 algorithm. The LLM Mixtral 8x7B was utilized to synthesize these data sources, providing comprehensive and contextually relevant responses to carefully designed CQs.

Reproducibility is a key principle of this work. By employing open-source tools, publicly available datasets and a transparent methodology, the research offers a modular and adaptable pipeline. Although designed for biomedical applications, the framework is domain-agnostic and can be applied to other fields, such as biodiversity, climate science and computational linguistics, enabling researchers across disciplines to efficiently extract and synthesize knowledge from vast datasets.

To evaluate the system’s effectiveness, metrics such as faithfulness, answer relevance, contextual relevance and groundedness were used. Generated responses were compared against expert-validated ground truth data. The results highlight the system’s ability to integrate and enhance information from diverse sources, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing complex biomedical questions. This thesis contributes to the field of AI-driven research by presenting a scalable, accurate and reproducible methodology for extracting insights from large datasets, ensuring that answers remain meaningful and grounded in evidence.
